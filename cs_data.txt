Iteration: Iteration is a fundamental concept in computer science that refers to the repetition of a process or a set of instructions in a program. It is often used in conjunction with loops, which allow a program to execute a set of instructions repeatedly until a specific condition is met.
Conditionals: Conditionals are another fundamental concept in computer science that allows a program to make decisions based on specific conditions. They are used to control the flow of a program by executing specific instructions based on whether a condition is true or false.
Computer languages and their applications: There are many different programming languages used in computer science, each with its syntax, features, and applications. Some of the most popular programming languages include Java, Python, C++, JavaScript, and Ruby.
